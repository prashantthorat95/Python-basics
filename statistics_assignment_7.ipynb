        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Part 1: Conceptual Explanation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to understand whether an increase in **advertising spend** leads to an increase in **daily sales** — in other words, if the two variables are related.\n",
        "\n",
        "To explore this relationship, we use **Covariance** and **Correlation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Covariance**\n",
        "\n",
        "Covariance measures the **direction of the relationship** between two variables:\n",
        "- A **positive covariance** means that when advertising spend increases, daily sales also tend to increase.\n",
        "- A **negative covariance** means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
        "- A covariance near **zero** indicates no linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula:**  \n",
        "Cov(X, Y) = Σ[(Xi - X̄) × (Yi - Ȳ)] / (n - 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, covariance alone does **not tell us the strength** of the relationship — only the direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Correlation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation measures both the **direction and strength** of the relationship between two variables.  \n",
        "It is a **standardized version** of covariance that always lies between **-1 and +1**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **+1** → Perfect positive correlation (as advertising increases, sales increase proportionally).  \n",
        "- **-1** → Perfect negative correlation (as advertising increases, sales decrease).  \n",
        "- **0** → No linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula:**  \n",
        "r = Cov(X, Y) / (σx × σy)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Interpretation for the Marketing Team:**\n",
        "By calculating the **correlation coefficient**, we can determine:\n",
        "- Whether advertising and sales move together.\n",
        "- How strongly they are related.\n",
        "- Whether increasing ad spend could potentially lead to higher sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Part 2: Python Implementation**\n",
        "We will calculate the **correlation coefficient** between advertising spend and daily sales using Python’s **NumPy** library.\n"
