        "Using bootstrap sampling, Random Forest leaves out about 36% of data as OOB samples. Feature values are permuted in the OOB data, and the decrease in performance is measured. A larger drop means higher importance. This method avoids the need for a separate validation set.\n",

        "The key idea behind ensemble techniques is to **improve predictive performance, stability, and generalization by combining multiple individual models into a single powerful model**. Instead of depending on one model, ensemble methods rely on the collective intelligence of many models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process begins by training **multiple base learners**. These learners can be of the same type (such as decision trees in Random Forest) or different types (such as decision trees, SVMs, and logistic regression). Each model learns patterns from the data independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure effectiveness, ensemble techniques introduce **diversity among models**. Diversity is created by using different subsets of training data (bagging), changing feature subsets (Random Forest), assigning different importance to samples (boosting), or using different algorithms (stacking). This diversity ensures that models do not make the same mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training, each base model produces its own prediction for a given input. Since models are diverse, their predictions vary. These individual predictions are then **combined using aggregation methods** such as majority voting (classification), averaging (regression), or weighted combinations (boosting).\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining predictions, ensemble techniques **reduce variance** (by averaging noisy models), **reduce bias** (by focusing on difficult samples), and **minimize overfitting**. Random errors made by individual models cancel out, while correct predictions reinforce each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, ensemble techniques produce models that are **more accurate, robust, and reliable**, especially when dealing with complex datasets or high-variance algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**  \n",

        "\n",
        "Random Forest is considered better than a single Decision Tree because it **improves accuracy, reduces overfitting, and provides more robust and reliable predictions** by combining the power of multiple trees instead of relying on just one.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Reduction in Overfitting  \n",
        "A single Decision Tree tends to overfit the training data, especially when it grows deep. Random Forest builds many trees on different bootstrap samples and averages their predictions. This process **reduces variance** and prevents the model from memorizing noise in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Higher Prediction Accuracy  \n",
        "Random Forest combines predictions from multiple trees using **majority voting**. Even if some trees make incorrect predictions, others correct them, leading to **higher overall accuracy** than a single Decision Tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Feature Randomness  \n",
        "In Random Forest, only a **random subset of features** is considered at each split. This prevents dominant features from controlling the entire model and increases diversity among trees, improving generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Robustness to Noise and Outliers  \n",
        "A single Decision Tree is highly sensitive to noisy data and outliers. Random Forest dilutes the effect of noise because not all trees see the same noisy samples, making the model more stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Better Generalization  \n",
        "By averaging multiple diverse trees, Random Forest learns more generalized patterns that perform well on unseen data, unlike a single Decision Tree that may capture dataset-specific patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Built-in Feature Importance  \n",
        "Random Forest provides built-in methods to measure **feature importance**, helping in feature selection and model interpretation, which is not as reliable in a single Decision Tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Handles High-Dimensional Data Well  \n",
